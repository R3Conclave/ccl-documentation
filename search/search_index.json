Let's start by defining those two: Conclave Cloud Portal The portal provides you the tools to manage your Conclave Cloud account and projects in a nice web-based interface. When you first log in you are presented with a list of existing projects and given the opportunity to create a new project. The definition of a project is below. Within a project you can check to see which functions you have deployed, how many times they've been called plus lots of other information and metrics about the platform. If this is your first time in here, create yourself a project and go and explore! Conclave Cloud Command Line Tool The \"Conclave Cloud Command Line Tool\" is known as ccl for short, as this is the command you enter to invoke it in the terminal or command prompt. The ccl tool provides all the management options available in the portal, but on top of this it allows you to upload and invoke functions without writing any client code. This is great for testing out your functions or trying out the Conclave Cloud platform. Enter ccl in your terminal or command prompt to see what commands are available. There is help available for each command too. For example, this will give you help for the functions command. ccl functions --help Projects A Conclave Cloud project is a specific configuration of the Conclave Cloud services. At the moment, because Conclave Cloud only provides the Functions service, a project contains a particular set of uploaded functions and shows usage and log data for just those functions. You can think of a project as an individual application or service. For example, you may have a project for 'Password Manager', or for a larger application you may have projects named 'Project X Payment Processor' and 'Project X User Data'. When experimenting with the platform, just create yourself a project named 'Test' or whatever you like. You can always delete it when you're finished. Functions Each project will allow the configuration of a set of functions for invoking using the Conclave Functions service. But what is a function? A function is a JavaScript code module that exports an entry point. The combination of this code plus the entry point name is uploaded and defines a single 'function' within the Conclave Functions service. You can upload as many functions as you want to, each obviously designed to perform a different task. You might find it more convenient to create an npm package and configure it using a tool such as webpack to assemble multiple files or even languages into a single JavaScript file for uploading to functions. In fact, you can even define multiple exported functions from the JavaScript module, then upload the same file multiple times but changing the entry point each time to create multiple functions. This is the approach used by the Conclave Cloud Password sample, so go and take a look at the source code for an example. Tenant ID and Project ID When you first open a project in the portal, you will be presented with two long values named Tenant ID and Project ID . The Tenant ID is the unique code that identifies your account. The Project ID is the unique identifier for the current project. Don't worry, these values are not a secret. You will need to provide these to the client SDK when you are writing you applications that use Conclave Cloud to tell it which set of functions to use. Function hashes You may see reference to function hashes in ccl or elsewhere in the documentation. These are a really important concept within Conclave Functions but much of the complexity is hidden from you. Whenever you upload a function to Conclave Functions, ccl will calculate the SHA256 has of the JavaScript code with the name of the entry point concatenated to the end. If the code or entry point is changed then the hash will change. Whenever an end user wants to invoke a function, they specify the hash of the code and entry point of the function that they expect to be processing their data. Once the Conclave Functions enclave receives the request, it will check the expected hash against the actual hash as calculated inside the enclave and will reject the invocation request if they do not match. This ensures the user is in full-control of what code can access their data. When using ccl , the tool will automatically use the previously calculated hash. This is not the most secure way to execute a function because if the hash changes, the ccl calculation will automatically update and call the function anyway. To counter this, you can manually provide a hash via the command line. When using the JavaScript or Java/Kotlin SDKs, you always need to provide the expected hash when invoking a function.","title":"Conclave Cloud Concepts"},{"location":"conclave-cloud-concepts/#conclave-cloud-concepts","text":"In order to get started with Conclave Cloud, you need to understand some of the key concepts you will be presented with in the portal and the CLI.

Sample description This Conclave Pass repository contains a set of projects that together implement a basic password manager service that demonstrates how to use Conclave Cloud services to provide a privacy preserving backend to an application. The end user can interact with the password manager service using both a web-based frontend implemented with Angular, and a command-line tool written in Kotlin. How do existing password managers work? Password managers maintain a database of password entries that are all protected by a single master password or access key. It goes without saying that the password database contains extremely sensitive information that the user wants to keep private. It is important that even the password manager service administrators are not able to access entries within the database. Password managers normally solve this privacy problem by storing the database using at-rest encryption in a database in the cloud. When the user wants to access the database on a new device, the cloud copy of the database is synchronised to the device in its entirety. All operations on the database are then performed in the client application or web browser. For example, the architecture used by LastPass is described here: https://www.lastpass.com/security/zero-knowledge-security. This approach is obviously very secure but comes with some limitations: If the database grows to a large size then it may take significant network bandwidth/storage on the endpoint device. There is no opportunity for sharing or collaboration on database entries. Now, in reality, for password managers these are not real limitations, but for the purposes of this demonstration project we can see that a Conclave Cloud based implementation can be used to solve these two issues by accessing the database inside an SGX enclave in the cloud. How is ConclavePass architected? A diagram showing the architecture of the project is shown below. Each component in the diagram is named corresponding to the directories in this repository that contain the implementation for the component. Each component is described below: Functions The functions consist of a typescript component that provides methods that can be used to add, query, get and remove entries within the user's database. This requires access to the unencrypted database and therefore, to ensure privacy, runtime encryption is used by hosting the functions within Conclave Cloud in the Conclave Functions service. Conclave Functions are stateless and do not have access to any persistent storage. Therefore, external storage within the cloud is necessary in order to persist the user databases. The functions component uses the JavaScript fetch() built-in capability to query and update an external data store with each user's encrypted database entries. It is vitally important to ensure that any data exchanged via fetch() is encrypted as the request is made outside the Conclave Functions Intel SGX enclave. The functions module uses another built-in function, crypto.getProjectKey() to get a key that is unique to the project and function code and uses this to encrypt/decrypt the user's database prior to exchanging it with the external storage. Backend The backend service is used to store and retrieve the encrypted database for each user. It only ever handles data that has been encrypted using a key that can only be accessed within the functions component, ensuring that no unauthorised entity can gain access to the user databases. The simple implementation provided within this project consists of a Spring application that stores the databases in a key/value map in memory. All entries are lost if the service is restarted. Frontend The frontend provides a web-browser application that allows login/logout and management of user keys. This has been implemented using the Angular framework and demonstrates how the Conclave Cloud JavaScript SDK can be used to interact with Conclave Functions. Cli The CLI is a terminal-based tool written in Kotlin that allows login/logout and management of user keys. This demonstrates how the Conclave Cloud Kotlin/Java SDK can be used to interact with Conclave Functions. How is privacy preserved? With the ConclavePass solution, the only component that has access to the user databases in an unencrypted form is the function code that runs within the Conclave Functions service. But how do we ensure that is the case? Conclave Cloud makes it easy to ensure that only authorised function code can access data. It does this by running the code within an Intel SGX enclave and providing an attestation that proves the validity of the platform as well as the integrity and authenticity of the code running inside the enclave. The details of this whole process are handled by the Conclave Cloud platform and the client SDKs. Let's take a look first at how a user sends a password to the service. The frontend or CLI will call the addEntry function, passing the user's password and details of the new password entry. This information obviously should not be sent unencrypted. Furthermore it should be encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the set of functions that have been approved by the user to handle the user's database. The Conclave Cloud client SDK obtains a public key from the platform that is signed by a report that proves the private key can only be accessed within an approved Conclave Functions enclave. The client SDK validates the report and ensures the key signature does indeed match the signature in the report. Once this key has been established we can encrypt data using this key safe in the knowledge that only a valid Conclave Functions enclave can decrypt it. The password entry is encrypted using this key and the addEntry function invoked. This is then picked up inside a Conclave Functions enclave which can decrypt the parameters using the private key that only it has access to. The function retrieves the encrypted user database from the external service. Once the function has the user's encrypted database it then decrypts it. The key used to encrypt/decrypt the enclave is derived from a number of sources, all of which need to be present to obtain the correct key: The Project key - this is the same key that is used to decrypt the function code itself and the invocation parameters that were provided to the function. The hash of the code that is executing. By mixing this into the encryption key we can assure that if the code is modified or changed then it cannot access the database. The user's password - by mixing this in we can assure one user cannot access the database for another user. The function decrypts the database, adds the new entry, re-encrypts it then sends it back to the backend. So, we can see that the only entity that has access to all the secrets required to access each user's database entry is Conclave Functions, and only then when running the exact same code that the user expects the functions to be running, and when provided with the user's password. Building and deploying the demonstration Each component must be built and deployed or hosted in order to run the demonstration. 1. Backend The backend service needs to be available as a fixed IP on the internet in order to allow Conclave Functions to access it for storing user databases. It is recommended to set up a new virtual machine with your cloud service provider to host this. The resource requirements are tiny so you can use the smallest size of virtual machine your cloud service provider provides. The service is built using this command: ./gradlew build You can then deploy the build/libs/conclavepass-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file to your virtual machine and run it with: java -jar ./conclavepass-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 2. Functions Note down the IP address for the backend service that you have just deployed and update the functions module to connect to the service with that address in functions/src/index.ts . Then see the instructions in functions/README.md for information on how to setup a Conclave Cloud project and build and deploy the functions ready for use. 3. Frontend The Conclave Cloud JavaScript client SDK is not yet hosted in a public repository so you will need to download and unzip it locally and update the frontend project to use your local copy. Instructions on how to do this and build and run the frontend can be found in frontend/README.md . Once the frontend is running you can access it at http://localhost:4200. 4. CLI The Conclave Cloud Java client SDK is not yet hosted in a public repository so you will need to download and unzip it locally and update the CLI project to use your local copy. Instructions on how to do this and build and run the CLI can be found in frontend/README.md . Usage notes This is only a demo of a password manager. As such, it provides only very basic functionality and error handling. There are a few things to note when trying the demonstration. The username is used as the user token When you enter your username, the name is run through a SHA256 hashing algorithm and converted to a hex string. This is used as the token for the user. The backend service stores and retrieves encrypted databases using this token. The password is set on first access The first time a user token is used, there is no entry within the backend service so it returns an empty string. The functions component assumes this is a new user and creates an empty database encrypted with the current password. All subsequent access must use the same password, and the password cannot be changed. Incorrect passwords are not handled well When an incorrect password is used, the decrypt function returns invalid data within the functions component. This is not checked and the JavaScript code subsequently fails. This obviously serves the purpose of protecting the database but is not a good user experience. This is something that can be improved in the demonstration code - maybe an exercise for the reader! The database is not persisted As mentioned above, restarting the backend service clears all user data. This is useful for demonstration purposes but does not make for a very useful password manager!","title":"ConclavePass Sample using Conclave Functions"},{"location":"conclavepass-sample/#conclave-pass-password-manager-implemented-using-conclave-cloud","text":"Github: https://github.com/R3Conclave/ccl-sample-conclavepass This documentation is a duplicate of the README.md in that repository.","title":"Conclave Pass - Password Manager implemented using Conclave Cloud"},{"location":"conclavepass-sample/#sample-description","text":"This Conclave Pass repository contains a set of projects that together implement a basic password manager service that demonstrates how to use Conclave Cloud services to provide a privacy preserving backend to an application.

This is then picked up inside a Conclave Functions enclave which can decrypt the parameters using the private key that only it has access to. The function retrieves the encrypted user database from the external service. Once the function has the user's encrypted database it then decrypts it. The key used to encrypt/decrypt the enclave is derived from a number of sources, all of which need to be present to obtain the correct key: The Project key - this is the same key that is used to decrypt the function code itself and the invocation parameters that were provided to the function. The hash of the code that is executing. By mixing this into the encryption key we can assure that if the code is modified or changed then it cannot access the database. The user's password - by mixing this in we can assure one user cannot access the database for another user. The function decrypts the database, adds the new entry, re-encrypts it then sends it back to the backend. So, we can see that the only entity that has access to all the secrets required to access each user's database entry is Conclave Functions, and only then when running the exact same code that the user expects the functions to be running, and when provided with the user's password.","title":"How is privacy preserved?"},{"location":"conclavepass-sample/#building-and-deploying-the-demonstration","text":"Each component must be built and deployed or hosted in order to run the demonstration.","title":"Building and deploying the demonstration"},{"location":"conclavepass-sample/#1-backend","text":"The backend service needs to be available as a fixed IP on the internet in order to allow Conclave Functions to access it for storing user databases.

Prerequisites In order to follow this tutorial you should already have done the following: Sign-up for the Conclave Cloud beta and log in to the portal. Download and install the ccl tool for your operating system and verify it works. 1. Create a new project A new project can be created either in the portal or using the ccl tool. Using the portal Click the \"New Project\" button and enter a name for the project. Using the CLI ccl projects create --name \"My Project\" You may be prompted to login using your Conclave Cloud username and password. 2. Set the project as the default project in ccl This is just for convenience to make subsequent command lines shorter. Firstly you need to get the project ID. You can see this in the portal project page, or you can find it using ccl . ccl projects list Set the project ID as the default, replacing [ID] with the actual ID. ccl save --project [ID] Write a JavaScript function using any editor Here's an example for you. Save it as 'simple.js'. cclexports = { sayHello: (name) => { return \"Hello \" + name; } } This creates a global object named cclexports that contains all of the functions that should be exported from the JavaScript module. In this case, there is one function named sayHello that returns a string that says \"Hello \" appended with the name argument. Note: The cclexports object is important. Conclave Functions will look for this when the code is uploaded to determine what functions can be called within the code module. Make sure you always populate this object with the function you want to call. Upload the function You can use the ccl tool to upload the function: ccl functions upload --name \"sayHello\" --code simple.js --entry \"sayHello\" At this point your function is live and hosted! It can be called from anywhere in the world! Just a word on the arguments before we invoke it. name is the name of the function that appears in the portal. code defines the code module to upload. entry defines the name of the exported function we want to call. The name and the entry do not need to be the same. Invoke the function Again, you can use the ccl tool to do this: ccl functions invoke --name \"sayHello\" --args \"[\\\"World\\\"]\" This should work and you should see something similar to the following: *** The expected code hash has not been specified and has been set to the value calculated when the function was uploaded.

However, due to the nature of enclaves, not everything works inside an enclave. Conclave Functions != Node.js Conclave functions provides a pure JavaScript engine. It does not provide Node.js support (yet). This means that you do not have access to Node.js built-ins such as file support or Buffer. However, you can create a project using npm and import standard packages to fill in the gaps, particular with support for objects like Buffer . The ConclavePass sample uses this technique, implementing an npm component that compiles to a single JavaScript file for upload, importing a cryptographic library, buffer and other useful tools. Accessing external web services Conclave Functions are stateless and do not have access to any persistent storage. Therefore, external storage within the cloud is necessary in order to persist the user databases. The JavaScript engine in Conclave Functions supports a subset of the JavaScript fetch() built-in capability to query and update an external data store with each user's encrypted database entries. It is vitally important to ensure that any data exchanged via fetch() is encrypted as the request is made outside the Conclave Functions Intel SGX enclave. Here is an example of using fetch() to GET a URL: cclexports = { lookup: async (url) => { var retval = await fetch(url); return await retval.text(); } } And another example showing a POST : cclexports = { lookup: (url) => { var retval; fetch(url, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: \"{ \\\"test\\\": \\\"Hello\\\" }\" }).then(result => { result.text().then(text => { retval = text; }, error => {}) }); return retval; } } Accessing a per-function cryptographic key In order to allow data to be safely exported from a function, an encryption key is provided that can be used to encrypt data that can subsequently only be encrypted by exactly the same function code within the same project.

This key is not used directly, instead it is derived using the hash of the code module that is currently executing. Note that it does not include the entry point in the derivation process meaning that a single code module that exports multiple functions will have the same hash, allowing a set of Conclave Functions to all access the same encryption key.

Conclave Cloud is a platform for hosting privacy-preserving applications. Built on top of the Conclave SDK, which in turn is built to take advantage of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), Conclave Cloud is a platform that will provide all the tools necessary to ensure that access to data is provided only to authorised parties. The Conclave Cloud platform will bring together an expanding set of services that will seamlessly integrate with each other providing a rich set of tools for implementing solutions without ever having to leave the Conclave Cloud platform. But we're not there yet! We don't have all of the services in the diagram above in the platform. In fact, we will be relying on our customers (including you) to drive the requirements for which services we should prioritise. So what services does Conclave Cloud deliver now? The current platform delivers our first service, Conclave Functions, which is a serverless execution environment, much like AWS Lambda or Azure Cloud Functions. Conclave Functions differs from other similar services by using end-to-end encryption between the end user and the container that runs the function, with data-in-use encryption provided by using a Conclave Enclave to run the code. The use of an enclave ensures the integrity and privacy of the user's data as well as providing hardware-backed assurances over the exact code that will be processing the data. With Conclave Functions, developers can deploy their code once to the platform where it will then be hosted for them. Their functions can be called once a year, once an hour, up to thousands of times an hour. The platform will cope with the demand and scale accordingly with no management or intervention from the developer. What can you do with Conclave Cloud/Functions? Conclave Functions allows you to write code that will run inside an enclave with absolutely no boilerplate whatsover ! This means that you can focus on writing your data processing logic that will run inside an enclave without worrying about how to transfer data to and from the enclave, or how to encrypt data, or how to ensure the platform integrity is maintained. You can prove to your users that the code that you say will process their data actually is the code that processes the data, as well as proving that you as a service host or author do not have access to the keys that encrypt the user's data. In fact, it also proves that nobody except the Conclave Functions enclave can access the data , and that includes R3 and Azure: our cloud service provider. Theoretically, any problem that can be solved using the Conclave SDK can also be solved in Conclave Functions. However, features such as persistence and authentication will be provided by additional services in the platform that do not yet exist. One thing to remember is that Conclave Functions are stateless. Every time you invoke your function in the Conclave Functions service, any previous state is likely to be lost. There is a chance that previous state is available in-memory but you cannot rely on it - the best you can do is use any previous state as a cache that can be used if present. Obviously stateless functions have limited use - you may as well just run the function locally on the user's machine if you don't have the ability save or share data from the cloud. Luckily, Conclave Functions provides an alternative to storing state directly. It supports a subset of the JavaScript fetch() API allowing outgoing calls to external services. This means that a function can retrieve and set data using an external service. Care must be taken to ensure private data is not leaked by the external call, as the actual call takes place outside of the enclave. But what problems can be solved with Conclave Functions? Conclave functions can be used to provide solutions or enhance the privacy for many different types of application, including: Pure data protection products such as cloud-based file storage with secure file sharing. Zero Knowledge Proof type applications, such as proving identity or age without providing the actual data to the verifying party. Multiparty computation where data is collated from multiple parties and derived into a combined result, without divulging the shared data with any other party or service. Private set intersection applications, such as allowing different institutions to find common data between their own private datasets and the data of other parties. Conclave Cloud provides a sample which shows how to implement a password manager using Conclave Functions along with a web-based frontend, a Kotlin-based CLI tool and a Spring backend for persistence. You can find the sample in this GitHub repository . The sample does not really fit into any of the categories above, but you can imagine expanding it to allow, for example, the service to automatically scan for compromised keys and notify the user.","title":"What is Conclave Cloud?"},{"location":"what-is-conclave-cloud/#what-is-conclave-cloud","text":"Conclave Cloud is a platform for hosting privacy-preserving applications.
